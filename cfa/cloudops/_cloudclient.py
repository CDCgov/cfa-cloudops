        A pool is a collection of compute nodes (virtual machines) on which your tasks run.

                container to mount and the local mount point name.
            container_image_name (str, optional): Docker container image name to use for tasks.
                Should be in the format "registry/image:tag" or just "image:tag" for Docker Hub.

                Use "default" for the built-in formula or provide a custom Azure Batch
                autoscale formula. Default is "default".
            dedicated_nodes (int): Number of dedicated nodes when autoscale=False.
                Only used for fixed scaling. Default is 0.
            low_priority_nodes (int): Number of low-priority nodes when autoscale=False.
                Low-priority nodes are cheaper but can be preempted. Default is 1.

        execution settings. Tasks are added to the job after it's created.

        Args:

                account. Can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Cannot
                exceed 64 characters. Spaces will be automatically removed.
            pool_name (str): Name of the pool where the job's tasks will run. The pool
                must already exist and be in an active state.
            uses_deps (bool, optional): Whether to enable task dependencies for this job.

            logs_folder (str, optional): Folder path within the blob container where logs

                0-100. Default is 0 (no retries).
            mark_complete_after_tasks_run (bool, optional): Whether to automatically mark
                the job as complete after all tasks finish. When True, the job will be marked
                complete without requiring explicit job termination. Default is False.
            task_id_ints (bool, optional): Whether to use integer task IDs instead of string
                IDs. When True, tasks added to this job should use integer IDs for better
                performance with large numbers of tasks. Default is False (use string IDs).
